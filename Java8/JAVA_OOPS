-File structure
===============
*In java file there can be any number of classes : code will compile happily
*In java file there can be only one public class.
*Public class and file name should be same.
*There can be mulitple classes in a file and each file can contain main method : Code will be happily compile and 
there will be multiple .class file after compiling and to execute it you have to give exact compiled file to see the o/p.

-Import statement
=================
*There are two type of import statements in Java:
	1. Implicit : import.java.util*
	2. Explicit (we are mentioning explicitly class name which we are using)	: import.java.util.ArrayList (Recommended)
	
	

-Default Imports(No need to import we can directly use the classes present inside these pacakages)
================================================================================================
*java.lang. -> String,Thread, Exception

-Default Pacakage
=================
If two classes are under same directory than import statement is not required we can directly create object
and can use it.

-Pacakage (A group of related items, also pacakage is Encapsulation mechanism)
=========
*A group of related classes and interfaces are grouped into separate unit.
*Pacakage is a keyword in java
*some ex : java.sql, java.io
*use internet domain name in reverse for eg. com.durgasoft.ocja
	Advantages:
	==========
	*For unique identification	
	*To avoid confusion naming conflicts
	*Moudalrity
	*Maintainbility
	*Security(Not accessbile from some other package until we import it)
	*Good programming practice to keep calsses in some package.
