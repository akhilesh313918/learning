-File structure
===============
*In java file there can be any number of classes : code will compile happily
*In java file there can be only one public class.
*Public class and file name should be same.
*There can be mulitple classes in a file and each file can contain main method : Code will be happily compile and 
there will be multiple .class file after compiling and to execute it you have to give exact compiled file to see the o/p.

-Import statement
=================
*There are two type of import statements in Java:
	1. Implicit : import.java.util*
	2. Explicit (we are mentioning explicitly class name which we are using)	: import.java.util.ArrayList (Recommended)
	
	

-Default Imports(No need to import we can directly use the classes present inside these pacakages)
================================================================================================
*java.lang. -> String,Thread, Exception

-Default Pacakage
=================
If two classes are under same directory than import statement is not required we can directly create object
and can use it.

-Pacakage (A group of related items, also pacakage is Encapsulation mechanism)
=========
*A group of related classes and interfaces are grouped into separate unit.
*Pacakage is a keyword in java
*some ex : java.sql, java.io
*use internet domain name in reverse for eg. com.durgasoft.ocja
	Advantages:
	==========
	*For unique identification	
	*To avoid confusion naming conflicts
	*Moudalrity
	*Maintainbility
	*Security(Not accessbile from some other package until we import it)
	*Good programming practice to keep calsses in some package.
	
*In any java program, only one pacakage statement is allowed, more than one pacakage statement
will give compile time error.
*Order of pacakage statement is aslo very important in any java program, first thing to be define in
the program is pacakage statement.
			For eg. after import statement, pacakage statement will give compile time error
			
			correct order
			=============
			pacakage statement;
			import statement;
			class Test{
			
			}


class level Modifiers
======================			
*public => this class is accessbile from anywhere within or outside the pacakage.
*default =>	- accessbile Only within the pacakage.
			- If class is not abstract, happily object creation is possible.
			- by using final keyword child creation is possible.

Modifiers allowed for Top-level classes are:
				-public
				-default
				-abstract
				-final
				-strictfp
Modifiers allowed for inner classes.
				-private
				-protected
				-static
